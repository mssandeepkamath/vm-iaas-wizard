## Overview

Minimal-IaaS-Manager is a versatile IaaS solution, written in Go, that caters to virtual machine management across a wide range of platforms. It offers a user-friendly CLI client that connects to a back-end server, allowing users to interact with virtual machines seamlessly.

- **Flexibility**: Designed in Go to work with various virtualization technologies and platforms.
- **Simplicity**: Provides an intuitive CLI, built with Go, for virtual machine management.

## Key Features

### 1. CLI Client

The heart of Minimal-IaaS-Manager is its powerful CLI client, built with Go, which simplifies virtual machine management, making it accessible to both novice and experienced users. With the CLI, you can:

- Create new virtual machines with custom specifications.
- Start and stop existing virtual machines with ease.
- Delete virtual machines that are no longer needed.
- Import, export, and manage virtual machine disk images.
- Configure basic networking for communication between virtual machines and the host system.
- Receive informative error messages that guide you through potential issues for a smooth experience.

The command-line interface (CLI) of Minimal-IaaS-Manager is developed using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), a popular library for building command-line applications in Go. Cobra provides a robust framework for creating intuitive and feature-rich CLI commands, making it easier for users to interact with virtual machines.

### 2. Backend Server

The CLI client communicates with a robust back-end server, developed in Go, that handles the heavy lifting of managing virtual machines. The back-end server:

- Integrates seamlessly with various hypervisors, allowing users to manage virtual machines across different platforms.
- Implements an API for communication with the CLI client, enabling easy scripting and automation.
- Provides a secure and reliable environment for virtual machine operations.

The backend server of Minimal-IaaS-Manager is built using [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux), a powerful router and dispatcher for building RESTful APIs in Go. Gorilla Mux enhances the capabilities of our backend, enabling seamless communication between the CLI client and the server.

### 3. Type-2 Hypervisor Integration

Minimal-IaaS-Manager leverages a Type-2 hypervisor, specifically QEMU, to efficiently execute virtual machines. QEMU is a powerful open-source emulator and virtualization tool that provides:

- QEMU supports a wide range of host and guest operating systems, making it suitable for diverse virtualization scenarios.
- QEMU allows users to take snapshots of virtual machine states and create backups, enhancing data safety and management.

Minimal-IaaS-Manager leverages a Type-2 hypervisor, specifically [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/), to efficiently execute virtual machines. QEMU is a powerful open-source emulator and virtualization tool known for its platform compatibility, performance, snapshot capabilities, and versatility.

The "User's CLI" represents the command-line interface that users interact with to manage virtual machines.
The "Backend Server (Gorilla Mux)" is the server component that handles incoming requests from the CLI and communicates with the Type-2 Hypervisor.
The "Type-2 Hypervisor (e.g., QEMU)" is responsible for creating, managing, and executing virtual machines.
